# **Cycling Trends Analysis with Python and Tableau**

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the London Bike Rides dataset to explore cycling trends and patterns over a defined period. Using Python for data exploration and Tableau for visualization, the goal is to create an interactive dashboard that offers insights into the number of rides, temperature, wind speed, and how these variables affect bike usage.

## **Tools and Technologies**

- **Python**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and initial analysis.
- **Tableau**: For building the interactive dashboard that visualizes the bike rides and weather data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running Python code and exploring the dataset.

## **Steps**

1. **Data Exploration and Setup**:
   - The data was first explored using Python (pandas, NumPy) to handle missing values and perform necessary transformations.
   - The dataset was cleaned, focusing on relevant metrics such as ride counts, dates, temperature, and wind speed.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - The cleaned dataset was imported into Tableau to create interactive dashboards.
   - Various charts and graphs were generated, including:
     - Time-series analysis to monitor bike usage trends.
     - Heatmaps to explore the correlation between temperature, wind speed, and ride numbers.
   
3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - An interactive dashboard was designed to provide insights into the data.
   - Key metrics were highlighted, such as the total number of rides, moving averages, and relationships between external factors like temperature and wind.

## **Files in the Repository**

- **`london-bike-sharing-dataset.zip`**: Contains the raw bike-sharing dataset files.
- **`london_merged.csv`**: The merged CSV file used for the analysis.
- **`CyclingTrendsAnalysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code used for data exploration and transformation.
- **`CyclingTrendsAnalysis.twbx`**: Tableau workbook file with all visualizations.
- **`cycling_trends.xlsx`**: Final cleaned dataset used for Tableau visualizations.

## **Key Insights**

- **Cycling Trends**: The number of bike rides tends to increase during moderate weather conditions and decrease significantly in extreme wind or temperature scenarios.
- **Moving Averages**: Seasonal trends show peaks in bike rides during spring and fall, with dips in summer and winter.
- **Temperature & Wind Speed**: Wind speed and temperature both have significant impacts on bike ride numbers, as visualized in the heatmap.
